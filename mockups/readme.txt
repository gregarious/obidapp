Hi Greg! Here's some info about the templates.

events_feed.template.html:
the most accurate markup and style. Have not added this to all feeds - not really necessary.

event_single.template.html:
Also an accurate single page. Specials and places are basically there, though class names, etc are not entirely accurate.

place_single.template.html:
Needs some hide/show functionality. The events/specials sections are just feeds. And the clover in the corner would be the option to star/favorite it. This will probably move.

Ok thanks! I wrote all of this in nano!
